Add CSRF token to form in django
Add unit test for lists/tests.py to process post request on server
    Post request failing for unit test, need to add new request method in home_page
        Added - if request.method == 'POST':
                    return HttpResponse(request.POST['item_text'])
        Rerun python manage.py test
Refactor to add posted content to table data.
    Add to home.html
        <td>{{ new_item_text }}</td>
    AssertionError: No templates used to render the response
        pass post response to the render function
