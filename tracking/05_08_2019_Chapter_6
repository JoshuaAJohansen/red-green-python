* podcasts allowing for no 'wasted' time.
They also give you the ability to 'participate' in long form conversations that wasn't possible in the past. You can learn from the leading leaders in two separate fields in two countries to synthesize those perspectives and apply them in your own context and setting.

Chapter 6
Add LiveServerTestCase so that the functional tests will use a clean database every time.
    It requires being run by manage.py test and will find any files that start with 'test'
    Create folder for tests
        $ mkdir functional_tests
    Django needs a folder to be a python package directory(i.e. one with a __init__.py)
        $ touch functional_tests/__init__.py
    Move test into new folder and let git know the file has been moved.
        $ git mv functional_tests.py functional_tests/tests.py
        This shows up in '$ git status' as:
            renamed:    functional_tests.py -> functional_tests/tests.py
    Run test using new command:
        python manage.py test functional_tests
        Test reaches expected point.
    Add LiveServerTestCase to test
        remove unittest and add new dependency
            from django.test import LiveServerTestCase
        remove local host port and replace it with self.live_server_url
        Remove if __name__ == '__main__' since DJango test runner will launch the FT.
Run all tests
    python manage.py test
Run functional tests
    python manage.py test functional_tests
Run unit tests
    python manage.py test lists
