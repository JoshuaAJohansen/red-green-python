Django ORM Continued:
on page 70:
Before adding to test ensure all are passing
    $ python manage.py test lists
    4 tests pass.
cmd + shift + o - 'tests' to open lists/tests.py

Moved from venv to Installed pipenv for dependency management!
    Knocked that off of my Important/none urgent tasks.
    Features - https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#-features
    *** Lockfile ensures truly deterministic builds
        No more dependency updates breaking servers due to changes between local environment and latest deploy.

Shifting back to the ORM
python manage.py test
    line 23, in test_can_save_a_POST_request self.assertEqual(Item.objects.count(), 1)
        AssertionError: 0 != 1
    Need to save the post to the Item
    Open views.py
